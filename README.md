# Licenses

> I just wanted to write something, and this was the first thing I thought of

## Serious licenses

These licenses I made with the purpose of actually being used.

So far there are none in this catigory.

## Half joke licenses

These licenses are supposed to be used only if you're fine with not having a real/good license.  
I didn't look over them a second time, so expect loopholes or similar. Don't sue me if they do. I warned you after all.

### Open License License

The [Open License License](OLL/OpenLicenseLicense) (OLL) is a license for licensing licenses, such that anyone can freely distribute or modify them.  
It specifically specifies the terms only apply to licenses licensed under it, so don't use it if you dont want to make the same thing you're seeing in this repository.

## Joke licenses

These licenses aren't supposed to be used. If you do, your fault (or joy, idk, maybe you like joke licenses).

Nothing here yet, though I got some ideas.

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute a license, be it a serious, half joke or joke one, fork the repository, add your license (or add translations or whatever you want) and then make a pull request.

If you make your own license, it should be in its own directory, which should share a name with the abbreviation for the license.  
The directory itself should contain the license in plain text in english, as well as any of the following (if you want):  
- Versions of the license in other file formats
- Sub-directories containing translations of the license. Please use the [ISO 639 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) of the language as the sub-directory's name.
- A `LICENSE` file, specifying under what license your license is licensed.  
If you can think of anything else, just add it. If it doesnt fit, I can always just tell you in the pull request.
